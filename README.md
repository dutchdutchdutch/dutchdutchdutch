# The Future of Working

### Agentic workflows, human-centric design, and resilient systems. 

I'm a forward-thinking professional working at the intersection of **AI readiness** and **workforce transformation**, focused on building product teams that decide better and move faster. 

My public repositories are hands-on experiments in how AI reshapes our work and our lives. Additional projects foster the discipline of personal health and fitness, finding ways to stay resilient and enjoy the journey.

### Current Focus

* **Agentic Workflows:** Moving beyond theory to build systems that plan, execute, and iterate autonomously.
* **Role Evolution:** Exploring how professionals stay "future-proof" by shifting from execution to high-level orchestration and judgment.
* **Human-Centric Design:** Designing workflows that keep humans meaningfully in the loop while offloading routine cognitive load.

### Selected Projects: 

* [AI Readiness Scores](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/signalscore) Spotting leaders and laggards an in AI adoption based on job descriptions and othe public signals
* [Claude Skills plugin](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/knowledge-work-plugins/tree/main/project-intelligence) A Process based project analysis plugin for Claude's Knowledge-Work-Plugins
* [BMAD contributions]() Program management skills for BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI Driven Development)
* [Lift Driven Skills Development](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/project-manager) Run baseline tests with generic prompts to benchmark custom skills

My projects are hands-on explorations, moving beyond theory to demonstrate what human-AI collaboration looks like in practice. I share this work to ground the AI conversation in real experimentation. Explore the repos below to see these agentic systems in action. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration.
