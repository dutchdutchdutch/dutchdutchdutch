# Shaping Work & Wellness

Program manager by trade, dynamic explorer by nature. I currently work at the intersection of **AI readiness** and **workforce transformation**, focused on building (product) teams that move faster and decide better. 

I believe that the sustained quality of our output is a direct reflection of the quality of our connections with teammates, our goals, and the technolgies we use.

While I’m not a career developer, I’ve experienced enough to practice the disciplines that make for the best solutions. Most of my public repos are hands-on experiments in how AI reshapes our work, alongside tools built to enrich my own health and fitness journey.

### Current Focus

* **Agentic Workflows:** Moving beyond theory to build systems that plan, execute, and iterate autonomously.
* **Role Evolution:** Exploring how professionals stay "future-proof" by shifting from execution to high-level orchestration and judgment.
* **Human-Centric Design:** Designing systems that automate the mundane, carving out space for human intuition and meaningful decision-making.

### Selected Projects: 

* [AI Readiness Scores](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/signalscore) Spotting leaders and laggards an in AI adoption based on job descriptions and othe public signals
* [Claude Skills plugin](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/knowledge-work-plugins/tree/main/project-intelligence) A Process based project analysis plugin for Claude's Knowledge-Work-Plugins
* [BMAD module](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/BMAD-METHOD/tree/main/src/pim) Program management skills to add on to BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI Driven Development)
* [Lift Driven Skills Development](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/project-manager) Run baseline tests with generic prompts to assess the [lift of custom skills](https://github.com/dutchdutchdutch/project-manager/blob/main/docs/eval-driven-development.md)

My projects are hands-on explorations, moving beyond theory to demonstrate what human-AI collaboration looks like in practice. I share this work to ground the AI conversation in real experimentation. Explore the repos below to see these agentic systems in action. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration.
